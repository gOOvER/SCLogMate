### Fixed
- **Star System & Location Detection in Nyx / Pyro / Stanton (`Core/Locations.cs`, `Core/LogParser.cs`)**:
  - Fixed an issue where players in the Nyx system were incorrectly detected and displayed as being in Stanton (e.g. at Levski, Delamar, or Nyx mission beacons).
  - Implemented dynamic active system tracking (`Locations.ActiveSystem`) and route origin extraction from `<Calculate Route> ... Projected Start Location is <System>`.
  - Added jurisdiction-based system detection for `People's Alliance (Nyx)` and `Ungoverned Jurisdiction`.
  - Fixed Landing Zone resolution for Levski on Delamar: `levski_all-001`, `levski_v2`, and other variants now resolve cleanly to `Levski`, `Nyx`, `Delamar` with Landing Zone classification and active armistice zone.
  - Prevented transient mission beacons (`MISSION_QT_Quantum_Beacon_LongRange_*`, `NavPoint_*`) from overwriting real player locations or falsely defaulting to Stanton.
  - Bumped `Database.CurrentParserVersion` to 25 to ensure historical sessions are re-parsed with accurate system and location tags.
- **Ore Radar & RS Signal Scanner OCR Recognition (`Core/Ocr/RsOcrScanner.cs`, `Models/RsSignalMatch.cs`, `Views/RsScanOverlayWindow.axaml`, `Views/ScanIndicatorWindow.cs`)**:
  - High-value cluster signature recognition (up to 16 nodes / ~52.000 RS): expanded the ship mining cluster ceiling (`CheckRs` in `Models/RsSignalMatch.cs`) from 2-6 nodes to up to 16 nodes. Asteroid clusters containing 3x-12x ores (e.g. 10.200 RS for 3x Lindinium, 21.350 RS for 5x Savrilium + Lindinium, 9.510 / 12.680 RS for 3x/4x Quantanium, up to 28.800+ RS for Bexalite clusters) are now fully recognized and decoded instead of being rejected.
  - HUD noise & bogus number suppression: removed raw candidate fallback in `ExtractRsValue` so uncataloged random numbers from ship crosshairs, coordinates, velocities, or roll angles are no longer falsely emitted as valid RS signatures.
  - Distance & velocity token filtering: added HUD readout filtering in `SanitizeOcrText` (`km`, `m/s`, `bn`, `deg`, etc.) preventing target range markers (e.g. `2.0km`, `16.5km`) from polluting OCR numbers or triggering phantom Salvage Panel detections.
  - Fixed OCR trailing HUD bracket noise and zero recovery replacement syntax (`${1}${2}0`).
  - Overlay UI redesign & text overflow fix (`RsScanOverlayWindow.axaml`):
    - Completely resolved text overflow where long ore names or location subtitles ran outside the overlay boundaries by replacing unconstrained horizontal StackPanels with responsive, strict-width Grid rows and functioning `CharacterEllipsis`.
    - Modernized glassmorphic HUD styling with a widened viewport (450px x 192px), deep navy glass canvas (`#F2081120`), glowing cyan telemetry header, and isolated telemetry badges for refinery bonus station and estimated market yield in aUEC.
  - Integrated complete resource database: embedded and dynamically loaded all 39 Star Citizen harvestable resources (`seed_data.json`), including Lindinium (Base-RS 3400), Quantanium (3170), Savrilium (3200), Bexalite (3600), Salvage Panels (2000), all FPS hand-mining gems (3000 RS) and ROC vehicle gems (4000 RS), complete planetary/belt spawn locations, and refinery bonuses across all stations in Stanton, Pyro, and Nyx.
  - OCR digit confusion recovery (8xxx -> 3xxx): fixed recognition of Lindinium (3400 RS) and other 3xxx signatures when Windows OCR confuses the Star Citizen font's rounded '3' with '8' (e.g. 8400 -> 3400), resolving to the exact ore signature.
  - OCR thousands comma recovery (71.200 -> 7.200): resolved an issue where the Star Citizen HUD thousands comma `,` was read by Windows OCR as `1.` (producing e.g. 71.200 instead of 7.200 or 31.400 instead of 3.400), automatically recovering the intended 7.200 RS (2x Bexalite) or 3.400 RS (Lindinium) reading.
  - Fixed overlay window pointer drag interception: removed `BeginMoveDrag` from the root container in `RsScanOverlayWindow.axaml` which previously swallowed mouse clicks on overlay buttons (`[⚡ Auto-Scan]`, `[👁 Box]`, `[🎯 Bereich]`, `[⚡ Scan]`) and prevented Auto-Scan from being toggled. Window dragging is now isolated to the dedicated title bar handle (`⋮⋮ 🛰 RS DECODER`).
  - Auto-Scan auto-activation: opening the RS Scan Overlay window or completing an on-screen region calibration now automatically starts Auto-Scan. Auto-Scan is also enabled by default in application settings.
  - Interactive Region & Box Controls: Added dedicated `[🎯 Bereich]` (interactive mouse drag-to-select region), `[👁 Box]` (manual toggle for on-screen indicator frame), `[↺]` (reset to default), and clickable Auto-Scan button directly in the `RsScanOverlayWindow` header.
  - Added `[👁 Box]` toggle button to the main window RS Scanner card alongside the calibration button.
  - Removed on-screen indicator frame popup on scan: the pink scan indicator box is no longer displayed or flashed on screen during background or manual scanning, leaving the in-game HUD completely unobstructed. The indicator box is now only visible when explicitly turned on via the `[👁 Box]` toggle button.
  - ScanIndicatorWindow color restoration: fixed an issue where `FlashGreen()` could inadvertently reveal a hidden indicator frame or overwrite custom accent colors and labels with hardcoded magenta.
  - Fixed Windows OCR dimension limit (2600px): `OcrEngineService.Preprocess` now automatically caps image dimensions and adapts scaling so large regions and high-resolution monitors never trigger Windows OCR argument or buffer overflow exceptions.
  - Optimized HUD color preprocessing: enhanced `Preprocess` with maximum color channel intensity detection and contrast stretching, converting amber/orange, cyan, green, and white HUD text into crisp, high-contrast black-on-white characters for maximal OCR accuracy.
  - Instant radar ping detection: refined `ConfirmDebounce` to trigger immediately on the first valid RS detection without discarding brief 1-tick radar pings, backed by a 2-second cooldown against duplicate spam.
  - Fixed Auto-Scan ToggleButton event race in `MainWindow.axaml` and `MainViewModel.cs` where two-way binding combined with Command double-toggled and immediately stopped Auto-Scan.
  - Upgraded OCR multi-scale scaling: added Scale 6 (24px padding) as primary pass for tiny Star Citizen 10-14px HUD fonts, with Scale 4 and Scale 2 fallbacks.
  - Reduced scan timer interval to 150ms.
  - Added missing ore `Savrillium` (BaseRs 3200) to `RsDecoderCatalog.cs`.
  - Added comprehensive diagnostics logging (`[RsOcr]`) to `SCLogMate.debug.log` recording capture dimensions, raw OCR strings, and parsed RS values.
  - Implemented capture safety margins (+30px horizontal, +15px vertical padding) around calibrated scan regions in `RsOcrScanner.ScanOnceAsync` to prevent ship/ping drift from truncating digits at the boundary.
  - Fixed digit parsing and thousands normalization in `ExtractRsValue` to reliably support spaced thousands (`7, 200`, `7. 200`, `14 400`, `14, 400`, `108 000`), RS prefix (`RS: 7,200`) and suffix (`7,200 RS`), and OCR character confusion (`O`/`o` -> `0`, `l`/`I` -> `1`).
  - Adjusted default uncalibrated RS scan region in `ScreenCapture.GetDefaultRsRegion` to vertically span 25% to 70% of screen height directly centered over the Star Citizen crosshair.
- **Exclusion of Logins / Spawns from Places & Locations (`📍 Orte`)**:
  - Filtered out `Im Spiel gespawnt (Station / Hangar)` and client spawn/login events from appearing in the Orte (Places) list and Starmap locations.
  - Reclassified player spawn events in `LogParser.cs` from `EventKind.Location` to `EventKind.SessionChange`.
  - Added database schema migration v10 (`PRAGMA user_version = 10`) in `Core/Database.cs` to reclassify all historical spawn events in SQLite from `Location` to `SessionChange`.
  - Added guards in `Locations.IsAmbiguous` and `MainViewModel.QuantumViews.cs` (`RebuildPlacesFromDatabase`) to prevent non-geographic spawn entries from counting as location visits.
- **Duplicate & Triplicate Event Ingestion and Display**:
  - Fixed an issue where financial transactions, cargo trades, contracts, and session events appeared duplicated or triplicated in "Größte Einzel-Posten", "Letzte Geld-Bewegungen", and financial calculations.
  - Resolved root cause where `RescanDatabaseCommand` and `LogArchive.Sync` collected redundant log paths across `%APPDATA%\SCLogMate\archive` and `logbackups` into database re-scans.
  - Eliminated rogue SHA-suffixed archive duplicates in `LogArchive.Sync` by overwriting existing archive files when newer/larger rather than creating divergent file copies.
  - Fixed SQLite multi-statement syntax error in `Database.IndexNew` that previously prevented cleaning old session events prior to re-indexing.
  - Added database schema migration v9 (`PRAGMA user_version = 9`) to automatically purge all duplicate events and duplicate session rows from existing SQLite databases upon launch.
  - Added `DISTINCT` queries in `Database.TopMoney`, `Database.RecentMoneyEvents`, and LINQ `DistinctBy` guards in `RebuildIndependentFinances` to ensure completely deduplicated presentations.
- **Places / Orte Re-Scan and Historical Sync**:
  - Fixed an issue where the "Orte" (Places & Quantum Destinations) tab was not updated upon re-scanning the database because location visits and quantum travel events were previously only populated from the single active log session.
  - Implemented `RebuildPlacesFromDatabase` to aggregate all historical `Location` and `Quantum` events across all database sessions and merge them with live events.
  - Added support for filtering by current session in `FilterPlaces` when "Session" is selected.
- **Database Re-Scan Progress Display**:
  - Removed duplicate inline progress bar and green status box from the Database settings tab that previously showed concurrently in the background behind the modal indexer overlay.
  - Completion status message now only appears when the database operation is finished (`ShowDatabaseCompletionStatus`).
- **Database Indexing Performance & Live Progress Banner (`Core/Database.cs`, `Views/MainWindow.axaml`)**:
  - Added a dedicated Sci-Fi live progress banner directly below the header bar in `MainWindow.axaml`, displaying the currently parsed log file name, live progress bar, and percentage whenever background indexing is active (`IsDatabaseBusy`).
  - Greatly improved database indexing and rescan performance by introducing in-memory batch caching (`PRAGMA cache_size = -64000`, `PRAGMA synchronous = OFF`), deferred index creation during bulk imports, and pre-filtering to only process genuinely unindexed files in `IndexNew`.
  - Progress percentages and file counts now report reliably without freezing or skipping.
- **Dashboard Account Card Session Metrics Display**:
  - Fixed an issue where literal `{0}` format string placeholders were visible in the dashboard Kontostand card for Einnahmen, Ausgaben, and Saldo.
  - Redesigned the session metrics row into sleek, color-coded cockpit HUD pills (emerald for income, crimson for expenses, deep navy for net balance) with clean typography and spacing.

### Changed
- **Modernized Fleet Deck Header & Controls (`Views/MainWindow.axaml`)**:
  - Replaced the harsh solid blue buttons with a high-end cockpit MFD segmented view switcher (`🏠 Mein Hangar` vs. `✈ Flug-Historie`) with active glow borders and count badges.
  - Replaced the bulky, inline ComboBox and blue "+ In Hangar" button with a sleek, discrete `[+ Schiff hinzufügen]` action button featuring a dark mobiGlas Sci-Fi popover flyout.
  - Upgraded telemetry KPI metrics into glowing cockpit HUD clusters with distinct color schemes (aUEC Marktwert in Emerald, Pledge in Amber/Gold, Flights in Sky Cyan, Quantum Jumps in Violet) and high-legibility monospaced values.
  - Elevated acquisition and manufacturer filter chips with dynamic border and foreground converters (`FilterActiveConverter`, `FilterActiveBorderConverter`, `FilterActiveForegroundConverter`) for refined active/idle states without harsh solid blues.
  - Modernized fleet search bar with integrated `🔎` indicator and `✕` clear action (`ClearFleetSearchCommand`).
- **Cockpit-Themed Controls & Button Redesign in Tools & Maintenance Suite**:
  - Replaced jarring solid neon/cyan and saturated blue button blocks across the `🛠 Tools` tab and `user.cfg` Tuning Studio popout with sleek, dark sci-fi cockpit controls (`Classes="ghost"`).
  - Designed dark navy and slate button backgrounds (`#0C1B2E`, `#081422`, `#141026`) with crisp, subtle borders (`#1C4B78`, `#162E48`, `#3B256B`) and refined hover transitions.
  - Centered all button contents (`HorizontalContentAlignment="Center"` and `VerticalContentAlignment="Center"`) across all styles and buttons, eliminating left-shifted text and icons.
  - Upgraded Windows Explorer quick-access bar to evenly stretched toolbar buttons (`HorizontalAlignment="Stretch"`) with crisp vector `Path` geometry icons (folders and cloud) in uniform cyan `#38BDF8`, restoring the dedicated `SCLogMate` application directory button.
- **Maintainer & Attribution**:
  - Standardized project maintainer branding and attribution uniformly to `gOOvER`.
- Bumped application version in `SCLogMate.csproj` to `1.0.0-beta5`.

### Removed

## [1.0.0-beta4] - 2026-09-03
### Added
- Interactive Sci-Fi vector financial timeline chart (`Views/FinanceTimelineChart.cs`) with hardware-accelerated Avalonia DrawingContext rendering, glowing neon dual curves (earned vs. spent with gradient fills), cumulative net profit trendline, and session cashflow histogram.
- Real-time interactive crosshair and floating mobiGlas HUD hover tooltip displaying exact timestamps, event names, transaction amounts, and running balances.
- Comprehensive financial KPI HUD header (Income, Expenses, Net Profit with margin %, live mobiGlas OCR wallet balance, and total traded cargo volume in aUEC & SCU).
- Chart mode switchers (Cumulative In vs. Out, Net Profit Trend, Cashflow Bars) and category filters (All, Cargo Only, Rewards/Transfers Only).
- Dynamic & extensible UI localization service (`Core/I18n.cs`) enabling instant, live switching between German and English across the entire UI without restarting; seamlessly updates all 12 main tabs, 8 settings sub-tabs, dashboard KPI cards, filter chips, location badges, status pills, and system messages.
- Application Language switcher: located globally in the main application Sci-Fi header bar (accessible from any tab) and in general settings; select between Automatic (System), German, and English with instant reactivity and settings persistence; controls language-specific features and conditionally hides German-only companion prompts.
- Aurora VoiceAttack test simulation toggle: test the uninstalled/unpurchased state with a single click in the UI.
- Direct Gumroad store purchase banner for the Aurora Log-Wächter package (`https://3415383443272.gumroad.com/l/yzpmoa`) displayed exclusively on German systems when Aurora is not installed or simulated.
- Native VoiceAttack & Aurora Log-Wächter integration: auto-detects installation in user documents, plays audio alerts (ship greetings for 73 ship classes, armistice/safety zones, restricted areas, monitored space, jurisdictions, quantum arrival, blueprints, player death, and server 30k errors) strictly read-only, and automatically grays out all controls if Aurora is not found.
- Parser diagnostics in `--scan` output for unmatched notifications and transfer headers that expire without an amount.
- Live Starmap location tracking after completed Quantum jumps.
- High-resolution multi-size application icon with Star Citizen holographic radar & quantum compass design embedded in the executable and taskbar.
- Integrated Developer & Debug Mode: configured strictly via `%APPDATA%\SCLogMate\settings.json` (defaults to active in local debug builds and strictly inactive in release/production builds).
- Developer tools sub-tab in settings (`🧪 Entwickler`) providing live Star Citizen log event simulation (Armistice enter/leave, ship boarding greetings, blueprint learned, quantum arrival, 30k error, death), state dumps to debug log, log clearing, and overlay reset.
- Strict security guard locking Aurora VoiceAttack simulation exclusively behind active debug mode (never exposed or active in production).


### Removed
- Removed misplaced finance and combat kill indicators from the Flight Recorder (`Flugschreiber`): purged finances (aUEC delta, trade transactions, purchases) and unlogged combat killboard stats from flight telemetry, keeping finances exclusively in the dedicated 'Finanzen' tab.

### Changed
- SQLite Schema v8 upgrade: added composite multi-column database indexes (`ix_events_session_kind` and `ix_events_kind_time`) for ultra-fast session querying and wipe-filtered event loading across tens of thousands of telemetry records.
- Optimized Flight Recorder session switching in `MainViewModel`: eliminated redundant timeline re-computations when selecting archived flights.
- Refined flight duration heuristic in `FlightRecorderService`: fallback cockpit duration estimation is only applied when actual sorties took place (`SortieCount > 0`), ensuring pure hangar/menu idle sessions report zero flight hours accurately.
- Corrected combat kill parsing in `LogParser.cs`: player victim lines are now accurately classified as `EventKind.Death` rather than generic kill events.
- Refocused Flight Recorder (`Flugschreiber`) strictly on pure aerospace telemetry and navigation: header now displays dedicated flight KPIs (`FLUGDISTANZ (QUANTUM)`, `FLUGZEIT & COCKPIT`, `SCHIFFSEINSÄTZE / SORTIES`, `NAVIGATION & ZONEN`), with streamlined flight event filters (`Alle`, `🌀 Quantum`, `🛸 Schiffe`, `📍 Orte & Landung`, `💥 Vorfälle & Verluste`).
- Comprehensive Flight Recorder rework: introduced a dedicated 'Flug-Explorer' dropdown (`FlightSessions`) allowing pilots to inspect either their full career timeline or specific individual flights with ship, duration, and system data, with direct 1-click waypoint focusing in the full Starmap tab.
- Decoupled Flight Recorder (`Flugschreiber`), Missions, and Finances from the top session dropdown: all analysis and telemetry tabs now display the complete career history across all sessions from the database by default, leaving the top session selector exclusively for filtering the main event log (`📜 Ereignisse`).
- Renamed the 'Erz-Scanner' tab to '⛏ Mining', integrating radar RS scanning, full 4.x resource catalog, and refinery jobs/live timers in one central place.
- Completely redesigned the Finances tab (`Views/MainWindow.axaml`) into a futuristic Sci-Fi financial analytics center featuring a 5-card HUD header, interactive vector timeline chart, dual-column category breakdown with dynamic percentage shares, and commodity trading margin intelligence.
- Join multi-line HUD notifications before parsing in archived sessions and live tailing.
- Index archived sessions by file size and last-write fingerprint so changed backups are parsed again.
- Save overlay positions after movement settles, debounce event searches, and render initial log events in batches.
- Migrate UEX API keys from `settings.json` to protected storage.
- Use stable SHA-256 keys and a 128 MB limit for the wiki image cache.

### Fixed
- Fixed overlapping horizontal scrollbar on Windows that obscured filter buttons in the Flight Recorder toolbar by restructuring the header into clean, non-overflowing rows.
- Restrict ship boarding greetings strictly to the initial boarding in a hangar/pad on a station: completely suppress greetings after ship crashes, collisions, destruction, player death, respawns, insurance claims, or quantum jumps, and only allow one greeting per ship family during a station stay.
- Fix country flags not displaying on Windows by replacing unrendered Unicode regional indicator emojis with dedicated, crisp XAML vector flags (German Black-Red-Gold and British Union Jack) across language pickers and badges.
- Completely eliminate false voice announcements on stations and during login/spawning: initialize IsAtStation from startup location, detect habs/spawns/hospitals, add a 60-second login grace period, and suppress Safety Zone, Monitored Space, Restricted Zone, and Jurisdiction voice alerts whenever the player is on a station or logging in.
- Upgrade Aurora voice playback engine to Windows Media Foundation player with volume control and live debug logging.
- Fix settings window bottom cutoff by compacting VoiceAttack control cards (single-row volume & test-sound, streamlined category tiles), adding a 160px bottom scroll margin, and reducing default window dimensions to 1400x780 (MinHeight 520) for optimal 1080p DPI scaled display support.
- Keep game focus when showing the Mini-HUD or RS overlay.
- Discard unfinished live entries on log rotation instead of carrying them into the next session.
- Stop a toast fade timer immediately when its toast is dismissed.
- Prevent stale tailer lines after a session change, serialize OCR work, and release native bitmap resources deterministically.
- Fall back to standard centered HUD scan region for RS OCR scanner when no custom region is configured.
- Prevent wallet OCR misreads by adding dual-read disparity rejection and requiring cross-grab confirmation (seen 2×).
- Improve OCR thread-safety in ContractScanner, timer disposal guards in RsOcrScanner, and lock synchronization on OcrEngineService disposal.
- Fix multi-size Windows application icon binary encoding to prevent startup bitmap loader errors.
- Allow retrying failed UEX location-data requests.

### Security
- Store UEX API keys with Windows DPAPI and mask the input until explicitly confirmed.
- Verify downloaded updates against the `SHA256SUMS.txt` release asset before replacement.

## [1.0.0-beta3] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- RS signal decoder and in-game scanner overlay for mining and salvage HUD pings.
- Windows OCR scanning with configurable capture regions and image preprocessing.
- Flight recorder timeline, session KPIs, and Markdown flight-report export.
- Pyro, Nyx, and extended Stanton locations in the Starmap.
- Reactive location and jurisdiction indicators.

### Fixed
- Aggregate flights by real sessions and deduplicate live sortie events.

## [1.0.0-beta2] - 2026-08-30

### Added
- Update dialog with automatic GitHub release detection and self-replacement.
- Progress modal for database indexing and re-scans.

### Changed
- Improve fleet sortie counts, contract merging, player detection, and database query batching.
- **RS Signal Scanner Overlay (`RsScanOverlayWindow`)**: Modernized sci-fi HUD design with widened layout (450x192px), vibrant cyan glass border, and dedicated rows for ore titles and rarity subtitles. Eliminates horizontal text clipping/overflow by placing title and subtitle in individual bounded grid rows with reliable character ellipsis, and splits refinery recommendation and aUEC value into distinct high-contrast telemetry pills.

### Fixed
- Prevent inflated flight counters and contract duplicates caused by the fallback contractor.
- **RS Signal Scanner (10.200 RS, 21.350 RS & Multi-Digit Recognition)**: Robust OCR detection for 5-digit signatures (e.g. 10.200 RS for 3x Lindinium, 21.350 RS for 5x Iron). Handles OCR misreads where commas are read as '1' in 6-digit sequences (101.200 -> 10200, 211.350 -> 21350) or '.1' (10.1200 / 21.1350), resolves 3<->8 middle-digit confusions (21.850 -> 21.350), 7<->2 prefix confusions, Z/z<->2 leading-digit confusions (Z1.350 -> 21.350), SO/So<->50 suffix confusions (21.3SO -> 21.350), truncated trailing zeros (21.35 -> 21350), converts letter confusions (IO / lO / |O -> 10), strips leading/trailing HUD bracket noise from 5- and 6-digit values, and adds diagnostic debug logging for unmatched OCR text.
