## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Dynamic & extensible UI localization service (`Core/I18n.cs`) enabling instant, live switching between German and English across the entire UI without restarting; seamlessly updates all 12 main tabs, 8 settings sub-tabs, dashboard KPI cards, filter chips, location badges, status pills, and system messages.
- Application Language switcher: located globally in the main application Sci-Fi header bar (accessible from any tab) and in general settings; select between Automatic (System), German, and English with instant reactivity and settings persistence; controls language-specific features and conditionally hides German-only companion prompts.
- Aurora VoiceAttack test simulation toggle: test the uninstalled/unpurchased state with a single click in the UI.
- Direct Gumroad store purchase banner for the Aurora Log-Wächter package (`https://3415383443272.gumroad.com/l/yzpmoa`) displayed exclusively on German systems when Aurora is not installed or simulated.
- Native VoiceAttack & Aurora Log-Wächter integration: auto-detects installation in user documents, plays audio alerts (ship greetings for 73 ship classes, armistice/safety zones, restricted areas, monitored space, jurisdictions, quantum arrival, blueprints, player death, and server 30k errors) strictly read-only, and automatically grays out all controls if Aurora is not found.
- Parser diagnostics in `--scan` output for unmatched notifications and transfer headers that expire without an amount.
- Live Starmap location tracking after completed Quantum jumps.
- High-resolution multi-size application icon with Star Citizen holographic radar & quantum compass design embedded in the executable and taskbar.
- Integrated Developer & Debug Mode: configured strictly via `%APPDATA%\SCLogMate\settings.json` (defaults to active in local debug builds and strictly inactive in release/production builds).
- Developer tools sub-tab in settings (`🧪 Entwickler`) providing live Star Citizen log event simulation (Armistice enter/leave, ship boarding greetings, blueprint learned, quantum arrival, 30k error, death), state dumps to debug log, log clearing, and overlay reset.
- Strict security guard locking Aurora VoiceAttack simulation exclusively behind active debug mode (never exposed or active in production).


### Changed
- Join multi-line HUD notifications before parsing in archived sessions and live tailing.
- Index archived sessions by file size and last-write fingerprint so changed backups are parsed again.
- Save overlay positions after movement settles, debounce event searches, and render initial log events in batches.
- Migrate UEX API keys from `settings.json` to protected storage.
- Use stable SHA-256 keys and a 128 MB limit for the wiki image cache.

### Fixed
- Restrict ship boarding greetings strictly to the initial boarding in a hangar/pad on a station: completely suppress greetings after ship crashes, collisions, destruction, player death, respawns, insurance claims, or quantum jumps, and only allow one greeting per ship family during a station stay.
- Fix country flags not displaying on Windows by replacing unrendered Unicode regional indicator emojis with dedicated, crisp XAML vector flags (German Black-Red-Gold and British Union Jack) across language pickers and badges.
- Completely eliminate false voice announcements on stations and during login/spawning: initialize IsAtStation from startup location, detect habs/spawns/hospitals, add a 60-second login grace period, and suppress Safety Zone, Monitored Space, Restricted Zone, and Jurisdiction voice alerts whenever the player is on a station or logging in.
- Upgrade Aurora voice playback engine to Windows Media Foundation player with volume control and live debug logging.
- Fix settings window bottom cutoff by compacting VoiceAttack control cards (single-row volume & test-sound, streamlined category tiles), adding a 160px bottom scroll margin, and reducing default window dimensions to 1400x780 (MinHeight 520) for optimal 1080p DPI scaled display support.
- Keep game focus when showing the Mini-HUD or RS overlay.
- Discard unfinished live entries on log rotation instead of carrying them into the next session.
- Stop a toast fade timer immediately when its toast is dismissed.
- Prevent stale tailer lines after a session change, serialize OCR work, and release native bitmap resources deterministically.
- Fall back to standard centered HUD scan region for RS OCR scanner when no custom region is configured.
- Prevent wallet OCR misreads by adding dual-read disparity rejection and requiring cross-grab confirmation (seen 2×).
- Improve OCR thread-safety in ContractScanner, timer disposal guards in RsOcrScanner, and lock synchronization on OcrEngineService disposal.
- Fix multi-size Windows application icon binary encoding to prevent startup bitmap loader errors.
- Allow retrying failed UEX location-data requests.

### Security
- Store UEX API keys with Windows DPAPI and mask the input until explicitly confirmed.
- Verify downloaded updates against the `SHA256SUMS.txt` release asset before replacement.
